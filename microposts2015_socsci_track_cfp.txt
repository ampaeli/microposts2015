    the 5th Making Sense of Microposts Workshop (#Microposts2015) 
			at WWW 2015

			18th/19th May 2015

=====================================================================

To foster collaboration between Computer Science and Social Sciences, and continue to encourage contribution from the latter domain to improve on 'Making Sense of Microposts', there will be a special track dedicated to Social Science papers at #Microposts2015. 


THEME: Big things come in small packages
-------------------

The #Microposts workshops aim to bring together researchers from multiple disciplines to debate current, leading edge effort toward analysing and understanding Microposts - "information published on the Web that is small in size and requires minimal effort to publish (e.g. a Tweet, Facebook share, Instagram like, Google +1)". Although individual Microposts are small and therefore typically focus on a single thought, message or theme, collectively they provide a rich source of information and opinion about a range of topics. The workshop aims to continue to provide a forum to enable discussion and hence, improve understanding of social and cultural phenomena that influence the publication and reuse of Microposts; to assess different approaches to gleaning the information content of Micropost data; and discuss application of this knowledge content in a variety of contexts, including emergency response, crowd and event tracking, mass communication, opinion mining and sentiment analysis. Enabling the understanding and application of Microposts requires techniques and tools that function at scale, and that are able to handle the very high rate at which Microposts are published.




TOPICS OF INTEREST
-------------------

The special Social Sciences track at #Microposts2015 will focus on topics including, but not exclusive to, first: 


Social & Web Science Studies
	- Collective awareness
	- Education & citizen empowerment, data journalism 
	- Civil action, media & politics
	- Political and polemical aspects of Microposts
	- Ethics, legal and privacy issues
	- Psychological profiles and psychological aspects of Micropost-based interactions
	- Cultural, generational and regional differences in access and use	- Inequality in access and use of digital, social media


Additionally, the topics below, detailed in the CfP for the main track, include topics of interest to the Social Sciences community, regarding obtaining understanding about, discovering knowledge content of, add application of Micropost data:

	- Emergent semantics	- Data mining from Microposts	- Opinion mining, sentiment and sentic analysis	- Network analysis and community detection	- Influence detection and social contagion modelling	- Prediction approaches	- Linking Microposts into the Web of Linked Data (i.e. entity extraction and URI disambiguation)APPLICATIONS: 	- Collective intelligence, user profiling, personalisation & recommendation	- Business analytics & market intelligence	- Event & topic detection and tendency tracking	- Microposts as second screen to television	- Geo-localised, Micropost-based services	- Public consensus & citizen participation	- Security, emergency response & health	- Effortless posting and wearable devices on communication 	- Linking social and physical signals for, e.g., crowd tracking




WORKSHOP STRUCTURE
-------------------

A keynote address from an invited speaker will open the day, and followed by paper presentations. We will hold a poster and demo session to trigger further, in-depth interaction between workshop participants. The last set of presentations will be brief overviews of selected submissions to the Challenge. The workshop will close with the presentation of awards.




SUBMISSIONS
------------

   Full papers: 4 pages
   Position papers & extended abstracts: 2 pages 

All written submissions should be prepared according to the ACM SIG Proceedings Template (see http://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/proceedings-templates), and should include author names and affiliations, and 3-5 author-selected keywords. Where a submission includes additional material submission this should be made as a single, unencrypted zip file that includes a plain text file listing its contents.

Submission is via EasyChair, at:  https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=microposts2015.

Each submission will receive, in addition to a meta-review, 2 peer reviews.


The #Microposts2015 proceedings will be published as a single volume containing all three tracks, via CEUR. Submissions to the Social Sciences track may, in addition to presenting novel work, include extended abstracts summarising or discussing previously published work or presenting position statements.
